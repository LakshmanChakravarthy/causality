>[Quasi-experimental causality in neuroscience and behavioural research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0466-5) by **Ioana E. Marinescu, Patrick N. Lawlor & Konrad P. Kording**

In this perspective Marinescu, Lawlor and Kording suggest the adoption of causal inference techniques by neuroscience that proved useful in econometrics. Particularly, they reflect on these techniques:
    1. _Regression discontinuity design_
    2. _Difference-in-differences_
    3. _Instrumental variables_
