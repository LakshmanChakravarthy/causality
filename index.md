>[Quasi-experimental causality in neuroscience and behavioural research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0466-5) by **Ioana E. Marinescu, Patrick N. Lawlor & Konrad P. Kording**

In this perspective Marinescu, Lawlor and Kording suggest the adoption of causal inference techniques by neuroscience that proved useful in econometrics. Particularly, they reflect on these techniques:

- _Regression discontinuity design_
  -Regression discontinuity designs: a guide to practice
-_Difference-in-differences_
-_Instrumental variables_
